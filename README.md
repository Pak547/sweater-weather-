# Sweater-Weather

## Description

This weather application intakes a city value and processes through the openweather API to retrieve valuable weather information for the client. Weather is a variable in everyone's lives and so it is imperative to have knowledge of the weather on a daily to 5 day forecast basis. I was able to implement the API and track the following metadata to retrieve it through the API's array.

## Installation

You may possible need to input your own API key through the openweater website.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

Simply input the city that you want weather information from
![Alt text](<assets/images/Sweaterweather 1.png>)

Consequently we will see the weather information propagate for current weather and a 5 day forecast

You will also have your inputs saved in the dropdown history button.
